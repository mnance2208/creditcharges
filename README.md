# creditcharges
Create a C++ program that will determine whether a department-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account.
For each customer, the following facts are available:
Account number (an integer)
Balance at the beginning of the month
Total of all items charged by this customer this month
Total of all credits applied to this customer’s account this month
Allowed credit limit
The program should be use a while statement to input each of these facts
calculate the new balance (=beginning balance + charges – credits)
determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit
For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded
the program should display the customer’s account number, credit limit, new balance, and the message “Credit Limit Exceeded”
